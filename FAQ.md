# FAQ

## How many photos can I post?

You can upload up to 15 photos.
We recommend uploading at least 1 photo with your furry face.

## Where do I list my fav treats?

Open the Hawt Dawg app and click Edit Profile.
Scroll down to the Passions section and tell potential mates and friends about the treats and toys that make your tail wag.
When you are done, click Save Changes to show the world.

## I don't see very well. How do I smell other dogs?

We're sorry! We cannot offer our customers smell-o-vision right now.
As soon as human technology catches up to dog noses, we will add a scent feature to our app.
Meanwhile, we suggest you meet your new friend at the dog park.
